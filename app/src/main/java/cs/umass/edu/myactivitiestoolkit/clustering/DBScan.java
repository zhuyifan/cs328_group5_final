/**
 * Created by snoran on 11/1/15.
 *
 * DBScan clustering implementation. Given a set of points, the DBScan algorithm assigns each point to
 * a cluster such that for any point P in cluster C, each neighbors P' of P is added to C if P has
 * at least {@link #minPts} neighbors. A point Q is considered a neighbor of P if {@code distance(P,Q)} is
 * at most {@link #eps}. Additionally, points may be marked as noise, meaning they fall in no cluster.
